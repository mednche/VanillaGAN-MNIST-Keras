# VanillaGAN-MNIST-Keras

This 

Standard GAN implemented on top of keras/tensorflow 


## Vanilla GAN
This is the simplest type of GAN and in this case the generator and the discriminator are just simple multi-layer perceptrons. Vanilla GANs simply just seek to optimize the mathematical equation using stochastic gradient descent. Letâ€™s take a look at the algorithm.


This is the algorithm for the very first GAN. It was taken from its paper written in 2014


## Data
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset composed of a images of handwritten numbers.

## Results
This is the progress on the Generator of my Vanilla GAN in only 100 epochs!
